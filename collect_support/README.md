# Collect Supports

This ansible snippet will login to devices and issue the cl-support command.
Once the CL support command has been executed and a new file is available, the 
script uploads the file back to the ansible server into the destination_directory.

Similarly, there is another matching script that will login to a switch and remove any existing CL support files.
